Python instrument server
Reinier Heeres

1. Introduction
This instrument server provides a framework to use a simple python instrument
driver to create a stand-alone process to communicate with an instrument. The
process communicates with other processing using the 'objectsharer' module.
Also included is a simple GUI to see and manipulate instrument parameters.

The main benefit of using this framework is a unified structure of instrument
control code as well as automatic type and range checking. By starting each
instrument instance in a separate process you can talk to instruments in
parallel (something which is a bit tricky to do in python in general).

There should be plenty of examples of instrument drivers to get you going. A
good starting point for a general GPIB/Visa compatible instrument would be
'Agilent_FuncGen33250A'. For instruments which come with a DLL you have to
know a bit more Python, but looking at LabBrick_RFSourceDLL.py might be useful.

2. Writing / testing instruments
Testing an instrument can be done from the command line if it contains a code
section like this at the end:

    if __name__ == '__main__':
        logging.getLogger().setLevel(logging.DEBUG)
        lb = Instrument.test(LabBrick_RFSourceDLL)

1. Start cmd.exe
2. Go to the 'instrumentserver' directory
3. Make sure python.exe is in your path (edit system environment variable)
4. Execute 'testins <driver name> <ins parameters>'
   - Driver name is the filename WITHOUT .py
   - Parameters can be specified for examples as --address GPIB::12 --delay 10

This will automatically call all of the 'get' functions to see if they are
working properly.
